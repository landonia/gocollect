# gocollect

The beginnings of a simple user data collection service that (currently) uses the BoltDB library

## Overview

I required a means of simply collecting user data mainly based on an email address.
Events (coming soon) can then be saved towards a user account and they can be fetched
based on a date stream and/or event type. An event can carry other params specific
to the event. It has no Authentication layer so it should be run behind a firewall
and accessed through another application. I intend to add in support for an event queue
that can be subscribed to for certain event types. I intend this to become a data store
that builds up over time to gain an overall picture of a user. Other bits of data can
be inserted as you gather more data.

## Installation
